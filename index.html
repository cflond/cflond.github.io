			                  <h3>Tarek Elachkar - Professional Services Director at Jahia Solutions</h3>
			                  <p>Charles is a natural born technical consultant: reliable, highly skilled, able to quickly get the big picture in a complicated technical and organisational context, very accurate when communicating with customers or co-workers, positive and full of enthusiasm, always ready to take up a new challenge. 
								In my experience, such qualities are hard to find when hiring an experienced consultant. Charles, despite his young age, was able to display those qualities at a level I have rarely seen. Should the occasion arise in the future, I don't think I would pass the opportunity to work with Charles again.</p>

			                  <p>Charles is an excellent consultant with deep technical and functional understanding. He is the quickest learning consultant I ever seen at Fredhopper. Charles is also really professional, he is a really organize person that manage easy big and stressful projects. I can only recommend him.</p>

			                  <h3>Ivan Anckaert - Head of Professional Services, SDL Fredhopper</h3>
			                  <p>Charles is a very much appreciated Consultant, whether by the clients, his peers, or myself. With his multidisciplinary skills, Charles delivers quality results that make a real difference on business and technology level. Hence, his solutions drive for added value to whichever party he collaborates with; especially the clients he has been working with. 
								His methodology, pragmatic and organized approach, energy allows him to handle multiple simultaneous projects while staying focused and respecting the deadlines or milestones, even during stressful moments. 
								Everyone will notice Charles' enthusiasm while he establishes professionalism, confidence and personal credibility. He is a great person to talk with, in French and English. 
								I consider Charles as a role model for consultants. 
								It has been terrific to have Charles as a Consultant on board of the SDL Fredhopper Professional Services team, and I would highly recommend him!</p>

			                  <h3>Georg Spielmann - Presales Manager at SDL Fredhopper</h3>
			                  <p>I greatly appreciate the time Charles worked at Fredhopper. 
At the first training I gave him it became immediately clear that Charles was going to be a great addition to the team. He has a true gift to understand complex problems and processes and to solve them on his own. At the same time in case of doubt he would immediately identify the best person to help out. He would seemingly easily create a deep relationship of trust with every customer he would work with. 
From start to end I was impressed at Charles learning curve and how well he fit into the team both professionally as socially. I have the highest regards for him and would not hesitate if asked to work alongside with Charles again in the future. 
I can only recommend him wholeheartedly.</p>
